***PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Do not report any issues you find here to the upstream repostory! All the bad code here is my fault!***

This is a fork of Sonic Worlds Next designed for a fan game called Sonic Circuit Intensity. So far I'm just messing around but I'm hoping to differentiate the feature set a bit more.

This project uses GNU Unifont, which is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](https://unifoundry.com/OFL-1.1.txt)
I seriously need to add a proper credit for it here!

# Differences from vanilla Sonic Worlds Next

- Widescreen suppport: Viewport resolution has been changed from 360x224 to 400x224 (which is what Sonic 3 AIR uses). Note that it's kind of glitchy!
- Partially changed the text to use Unifont rather than the normal pixel font to better account for internationalisation
- Default keyboard controls have been changed to the ones used by Sonic Mania (A, S and D simulate A, B and C respectively)
- Dedicated super theme
- Split level paths

### Planned Features

- World map system
- Score-based per-level ranking system (similar to an S3AIR mod that I'm working on)
- More playable characters (specifically Mighty and Ray; maybe a few others)
- Replace Amy's moveset with her Superstars abilities (SWN uses her Origins moveset
- Actual Special Stages using Godot's 3D features

# Sonic Worlds Next

This is the official development repository for the successor to Sonic Worlds Delta.

This uses [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/) to implement a 2D Sonic the Hedgehog-like framework, intended for use in creating fangame projects and original game projects. Godot 4 support will be prioritized once it has reached stable status. Like Godot, the code within this repository is provided under the MIT License.
 if you use godot 3 use the [Godot 3 Branch here](https://github.com/Techokami/SonicWorldsNext/tree/Sonic-Worlds-Next-Godot-3).
